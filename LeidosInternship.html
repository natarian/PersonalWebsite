        I worked on the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) program with the systems performance team, in the systems engineering department.
        I led a tool trade study in an effort to replace an outdated discrete-event simulation model which simulates the performance of the
        ERAM operational software that is used by air traffic controllers. I used MATLAB, Simulink, and the SimEvents package to develop a new
        system performance model prototype of the air traffic control systems. The intent of this project was to replace the current running model.
        By the end of my internship, I successfully built a simutlation model, which dispayed promising methods for modernizing and upgrading the
        current simulation model. Throught this process I learned how to read, use, and create systems engineering diagrams. I also contributed
        to a written report and analysis of the trade study.  Throughout all my hard work, I managed to still make time to participate in our site-wide
        air hockey competition and was humbled to be crowned the Gaithersburg Leidos Air Hockey Champion!
