      <p>
        I am a software engineering intern for Linear Labs, LLC at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD.</br>
        My primary goal is to continue the maintenance and development of XINA (XINA Is Not an Acronym), our database management platform. </br>
        My contributions to the team have included the following skills: </br>
        • Maintain and develop the XINA data management system </br>
        • Design front-end features of the XINA platform with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </br>
        • Develop functional widgets through custom HTML elements with AngularJS </br>
        • Utilize AngularJS, Bootstrap, and jQuery JavaScript frameworks, as well as Google Chart and Highcharts APIs </br>
        • Query data from XINA databases using SQL </br>
      </p>
      </br>
      <h2 style="padding-bottom:10px">First Project</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;During the first few weeks of my internship, my time has solely been put towards working on the MAG Site GOES Tool.
        This involves data from a magnetometer on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES).  The GOES is
        geostationary, meaning it stays in the same position with respect to the rotating Earth.  This satellite tracks weather
        data so we can monitor severe weather conditions like hurricanes, tornadoes, and flash floods.  My job is to query the
        data from the proper database, and then make the complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable.  I plot the
        data into charts to visualize it and add various usability features based on mission needs.  We have massive amounts of
        data hosted on our servers, so the most important part is sifting through it, pulling it from the server, and filtering
        it so we can actually use the data.
      </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The most notable improvements I made on this tool are the binning feature and the
        timeline.  Since there is so much data (sometimes hundred of data points per second), binning the data is a way of viewing
        more values at once.  We can't just query every single data point, but we can do some pre-processing to group the data into
        time intervals.  I added a binning widget into the GOES tool so the data can be binned by minute, hour, or day (or binning can be set to off).
        I also developed a timeline widget using Google Chart API.  This increased ease of usability for both users and developers of this tool. The
        timeline shows the days for which data is logged, organized by the database name.  You can click a day on the timeline, and it will load
        that day’s data directly into the plot. My team agreed that it would be useful to add timelines like this into other tools as well, so
        my next assignment became writing custom AngularJS directives so we could easily add a timeline to any tool.
