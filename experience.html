         I am a junior at the University of Maryland College Park, pursuing a double degree in applied mathematics and computer science. I'm currently available for full-time opportunities, starting after May 2019. I have previous experience as a systems engineering intern at Leidos in Gaithersburg, MD. I have also committed to an internship as a software engineer at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD for Summer 2018. I'm a diligent worker and adept at picking up new skills on the job. Feel free to contact me to discuss any positions that meet my qualifications and skill set.
