         I am a rising senior at the University of Maryland College Park, pursuing a double degree in applied mathematics and computer science.
         I'm currently available for full-time opportunities, starting after May 2019. I have previous experience as a systems engineering
         intern at Leidos in Gaithersburg, MD. I have also committed to an internship as a software engineer at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
         in Greenbelt, MD for Summer 2018. I'm a diligent worker and adept at picking up new skills on the job. Feel free to contact me to discuss
         any positions that meet my qualifications and skill set.
